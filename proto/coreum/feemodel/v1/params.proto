// - between "long average block gas" and EscalationStartBlockGas (EscalationStartBlockGas = MaxBlockGas * EscalationStartFraction) where we offer gas price with maximum discount all the time
// - between EscalationStartBlockGas (EscalationStartBlockGas = MaxBlockGas * EscalationStartFraction) and MaxBlockGas where price goes up rapidly (being an output of a power function) from gas price with maximum discount to MaxGasPrice  (MaxGasPrice = InitialGasPrice * MaxGasMultiplier)
