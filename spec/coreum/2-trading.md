#Trading and authorizations
All issued assets (tokens) are **tradable on the Blockchain’s built in DEX**. However, tokens who require “authorization” can only be traded by those who are authorized (whitelisted).

A user can obtain any token either by receiving it or trading it on the Blockchain. For both methods, the Blockchain must check whether the token requires authorization, and if so, whether the **user is authorized to receive it through trading or if authorization is not required**, then the user can obtain these tokens.

It is also important that a user can’t trade and **obtain an asset with an amount that exceeds its limit** set by the token issuer.
