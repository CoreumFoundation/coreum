#Bridges
A user will be able to connect to the bridge by connecting his wallet in the blockchain from which he wants to transfer his assets, 
then he has to indicate the address of his wallet in the coreum blockchain to which his funds should be transferred. 

After sending funds to the bridge, he will be able to connect the wallet in the new coreum blockchain to receive funds.

Users will be able to transfer the following currencies **from their native blockchains to the new coreum blockchain** through the system of bridges:
- BTC
- ETH & ERC20 Tokens
- BNB & BEP20 Tokens
- XRP & XRPL Based Issued Tokens
