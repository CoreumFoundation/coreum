## Overview
The [Coreum blockchain](https://www.coreum.com/) will be built on top of **Cosmos SDK**. The ecosystem features native capability to issue and mint tokens, a built in DEX to trade native and issued tokens as well as a **bridge to interoperability** across multiple chains such as **BTC, ETH and XRP**.

Coreum is fast, low cost and environmentally friendly. A sample use case of the Corem blockchain is the [Sologenic ecosystem](https://sologenic.org) which is currently mounted on XRP ledger.

The **native token** is called **$CORE** and it is used for **fees**, **rewards** and an **intermediary asset** market making in the DEX using a synthetic orderbook.

## Bridges
The system of bridges will allow operators to create a gateway and allow for other assets from other Blockchains such as **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Binance Smart Chain** or **XRP Ledger** to interoperate and be wrapped in the Coreum Blockchain.

This brings a huge value to the users of the coreum Blockchain by allowing them to trade such assets on the Decentralized Exchange.

## Decentralized exchange (DEX)

The Decentralized Exchange is a native, allowing for a low-fee, secure and fast trading activity.
The DEX can facilitate trading of any issued asset as well as $CORE within its function. Users of the Blockchain can choose any asset as a base pair and quote pairs and the market should automatically be created for such pairs.
